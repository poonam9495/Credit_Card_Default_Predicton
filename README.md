# Credit Card Default Prediction End To End ML Project.


# Introduction:
This is the end to end ML Project of Credit Card Default Prediction. It based on Classification Model for a most common dataset. Here is the Prediction of the next month credit card defaulter based on demographic and last six months behavioral data of customers.

# Overview:
Many times there are situations happens like credit card goes out of control;Due to many reasons like Loss of job, medical crisis or business failure are some of the reasons that can impact your finances. In fact, credit card debts are usually the first to get out of hand in such situations due to Finance charges and penalties.
We may have missed credit card payments once or twice because of forgotten due dates or cash issues. But what happens when this continues for months? How to predict if a customer will be defaulter in next months?

To reduce the risk of Banks, this model has been developed to predict customer defaulter based on demographic data like gender, age, marital status and behavioral data like last payments, past transactions etc.

# Dataset Information:
This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.

# Technical Aspects:
There are mainly 2 major parts in this project.
1.Training a RandomForestClassifier model to predict defaulter as accurate as possible.
Cleaning the datasets, fixing all features
Apply Classification ML model
2.Building and hosting a Flask web app.
Build the web app using Flask API
Upload the project on GitHub
Get the customer information from Web app
Display the prediction.
